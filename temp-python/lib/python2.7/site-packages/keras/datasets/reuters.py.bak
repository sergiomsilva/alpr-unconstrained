    # Arguments
        path: where to cache the data (relative to `~/.keras/dataset`).
        num_words: max number of words to include. Words are ranked
            by how often they occur (in the training set) and only
            the most frequent words are kept
        skip_top: skip the top N most frequently occurring words
            (which may not be informative).
        maxlen: truncate sequences after this length.
        test_split: Fraction of the dataset to be used as test data.
        seed: random seed for sample shuffling.
        start_char: The start of a sequence will be marked with this character.
            Set to 1 because 0 is usually the padding character.
        oov_char: words that were cut out because of the `num_words`
            or `skip_top` limit will be replaced with this character.
        index_from: index actual words with this index and higher.

    # Returns
        Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.

    Note that the 'out of vocabulary' character is only used for
    words that were present in the training set but are not included
    because they're not making the `num_words` cut here.
    Words that were not seen in the training set but are in the test set
    have simply been skipped.
